Quantifying Variation in Complex Visual Traits
-----------------------

Use Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) to summarize the differences among clusters in a highly multivariate dataset. Trinidadian guppies have extremely complex visual traits. Summarizing the differences among different clusters of visual traits allows policy makers to measure this variation, which helps conservationists predict the ability of this species to adapt in response to changing environments.

Visualize the clusters described by DAPC using a grouped scatterplot, and create heatmaps to visualize the meaning of the axes (discriminant functions) of the scatterplot.

Below are the instructions for running the underlying R code.

Instructions
-----------------------

* Clone this repo to your computer
* Open the R project, Guppy_Color_genetics.Rproj
* Inside the R project, open DAPC_heatmaps.R
* Use renv to recreate the project's environment:
    * renv will automatically bootstrap itself when you open the project
    * you can use renv::status() to see what packages (and versions) must be installed for the code to run
    * use renv::restore() to automate installation of these packages
* Run the script
